# Philosophy 
Authoring, storing, and retrieving documents are activities central to the humanities research workflow. And yet, many scholars base their practice on [proprietary tools](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html) and formats that fall short of even the most basic requirements of academic writing. The reader will relate to being frustrated with the fragility of footnotes, bibliographies, figures, and book drafts authored in MS Word. Still, most journals insist on submissions in .docx format. More than causing personal frustration, the reliance on fragile tools and formats has long-term negative implications for the community. In such an environment, journals must outsource typesetting, alienating authors from the material contexts of publication and furthermore adding unnecessary barriers to the unfettered circulation of knowledge. Closed formats ultimately lead to closed intellectual communities.

In this tutorial, we would like to suggest an alternative workflow built around open-source tools and transparent formats. Inspired by best practices in a variety of disciplines, we were guided by the following principles:

## Principles

1. *Preference for plain-text, fully transparent, human-readable formats.* When writing in Word or Google Docs, what you see is not what you get. The file contains hidden automatically-generated formatting characters. When things go wrong, the obfuscated typesetting layer is difficult to troubleshoot. Plain text ensures transparency and answers to the standards of long-term preservation. MS Word may go the way of Word Perfect in the future, but plain text will always remain easy to read, catalog, mine, and transform. As an additional feature, plain text enables easy and powerful versioning of the document. 

2. *Platform independence.* Writing in plain text means you can easily share, edit, and archive your documents in virtually any environment. Your plain text files will be accessible on cell phones, tablets, or, perhaps, on a low-powered terminal in some remote library. Plain text is backwards compatible and future proof. Whatever software or hardware comes along next, it will be able to understand your plain text files. 

3. *Separation of form and content.* Writing and formatting at the same time is distracting. The idea is to write first, and format later, as close as possible to the time of publication.

4. *Support for the academic apparatus.* The workflow needs to handle footnotes, figures, and bibliographies gracefully.

5. *One source many destinations.* As the vectors of publication multiply, we need to be able to generate a multiplicity of formats including for slide projection, print, web, and mobile. Ideally, we would like to be able to generate most common formats without breaking bibliographic dependencies. 

# Use cases

In this tutorial, you will learn to use [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) -- a "universal markup converter" run from the command line -- to convert a plain text file into a number of beautifully formatted file types: PDF, .docx, HTML, .tex, slide decks, and more. 

We will cover three use cases here. In the **first**, you will learn the basics of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) -- an easy to read and write plain text markup syntax -- and use Pandoc to generate a simple .pdf file.^[Don't worry if you don't understand any of this terminology yet!] In the **second**, we will add some figures and bibliography, generate an MS Word document, and then change the citation style form MLA to Chicago. **Finally**, we will use Pandoc in conjunction with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) to make some attractive slides. File management and versioning using Git will be covered in another tutorial.

Markdown and LaTeX answer all of these requirements. We choose to author the primary text in Markdown (and not LaTeX) because it offers the most light-weight and clutter free syntax (hence, mark  *down*) and because when coupled with Pandoc it allows for the greatest flexibility in outputs (including .doc and .tex files).^[There are no good solutions for arriving at MS Word from LaTeX.]

As a side-effect of this tutorial, you will be introduced to the basics of command line file management--a skill necessary for many more advanced research workflows. 

# Mindset
Readers with experience in data science, software development, or server administration may want to skip this section and go straight to software requirements. For all others, we would like to take a moment to discuss what to do when things go wrong. It it quite likely, that at several points of this (or any other) tutorial commands, or instruction will fail to work as expected. The magic of computing is in its universal reproducibility. Software works in similar ways on varied platforms, on machines in various state of disrepair, and under the precarious conditions of competing standards, formats, and protocols. The *Programming Historian 2* has a good guide on "what to do if you get stuck."^[http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/troubleshooting] In addition to the many helpful tips there, we suggest learning about the IRC chat channels which provide near-instantaneous help on many of the tools discussed in this article. Generally, your troubleshooting heuristic should start with googling the exact error message (by using double quotes in Google), asking the IRC channel, and finally posting to relevant Q&A sites like Stack Exchange or Digital Humanities Questions & Answers.

We this in mind, we purposefully omit some of the granular step-by-step instructions that relate to specific software. For example, it makes no sense to provide installation instructions for Notepad++, when the Notepad++ website will always have instructions that are both more current and more complete. Similarly, the features of Pandoc are best explored by searching for "Pandoc markdown" on Google, with the likely first result being Pandoc's homepage.

The most important thing in following this (or any other) tutorial, is to understand the "big picture" and to show initiative to find solution tailored for your own environment. 

# Software requirements
You will need to following software installed on your computer:

* A **plain text editor**. For beginners, we recommend [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) on a Mac, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows, and [gEdit](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) for Linux. More advanced users may want to experiment with flavors of Emacs of Vim. It does not matter what you use as long as it is explicitly a plain text editor. 

* **Pandoc** (detailed, platform-specific installation instructions [available here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)). Pandoc was created and is maintained by John MacFarlane at the University of California Berkeley. This is humanities computing at its best and will serve as the engine of our workflow. With Pandoc, you will be able to compile text and bibliography into beautifully formatted and flexible documents. To verify that Pandoc is installed, enter ```pandoc --version``` into the command line.

* **LaTeX** (detailed, platform-specific installation instructions [available here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)). Although LaTeX is not covered in this tutorial, it is used by Pandoc for .pdf creation. Advanced users will often convert into LaTeX directly to have more granular control over the typesetting of the .pdf.

# Case 1: Markdown basics

In this scenario, we will create a Markdown file and use Pandoc to publish that text in a formatted PDF. The basics of Markdown syntax [are available here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and you can test it out using [this online dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus). But what follows will cover everything required for a basic humanities document.

To begin, create a folder into which you will save all of your projects. Open a new file using your plain text editor and save it as "project.md". In this file, type the following:

# Philosophy 
Authoring, storing, and retrieving are *central* activities.^[Clarified here.] 

But many scholars work with [proprietary](http://bit.ly/HDjFBs) tools.

## Principles

- **Preference for Plain Text** and human readable formats.
- **Platform Independence** means share and edit in any environment.

# Use Cases

In this tutorial, you will learn the following.
```

At the top, nested between lines containing --- and ... you have a YAML metadata header. It declares the project's title, author, and date. Once this header has been created, you can begin with the body of your document.

A hashtag signals a header (```# Introduction```) while a double hashtag signals a subheader (```## Background```).  Italic text is encased in ```*single*``` asterisks, while bold text is signaled by ```**two**``` asterisks. A carat and brackets contains text that will be included as a footnote, and hyperlinks can be made by putting the text to be linked in brackets and the URL directly next to it in parentheses.

Save this file, and navigate to the directory containing it in your Terminal. If you are unfamiliar using the command line, the Scholars' Lab [Command Line Bootcamp](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/tutorials/bash/) will prove useful.  At the command prompt for your project directory, type:

```
pandoc -o project.pdf project.md
```

This command uses Pandoc to output (-o) a PDF filename of your choice, based on your Markdown file.  In order to number your section headers, include ```--number-sections``` and to include a table of contents at the top of the document, include ```--toc``` in your command, directly after the PDF file you have named.  Thus, the new command would look like this:

```
pandoc -o project.pdf --number-sections --toc project.md
```

If everything has gone smoothly, you will now have a PDF file in your project folder that looks like this:
