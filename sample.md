# Philosophy 
Authoring, storing, and retrieving documents are activities at the center of the humanities research workflow. And yet, we base our practice on propriatery tools and formats which struggle with even the most basic requirements of academic writing. Many of the readers will relate to being frustrated with the fragility of footnotes, bibliographies, figures, and book drafts authored in MS Word. Still, many journals insist on submisisons in .docx format. More than causing personal frustration, the reliance on fragile tools and formats has long-term negative implications for the community. Writing becomes aliented form tlypesetting, inviting third In this tutorial, we suggest an alternative way 

The idea is to start with a plain text, lightweight, durable, and human-readable format like markdown and finish typesetting in something more robust like LaTeX. You want to delay the converstion as close as possible to publication--it becomes expensive to switch formats once you convert to .tex or .docx.
Start in markdown (.text) for early drafts. Once you commit to the publication venue, use Pandoc to cast into either Open Office (.odt and later .doc) or LaTeX (.tex) or HTML and clean up from there.
